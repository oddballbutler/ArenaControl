ArenaControl
============

Qt program to control arenas.

Right now it requires you to use the K8055 interface board. I am working on changing this so that you can use whatever control board you want.

Current Features:
  Programmable Timer
  Light post control
  
Future Features:
  Control Board plugin framework.
  Ability to send custom commands to your control board.
